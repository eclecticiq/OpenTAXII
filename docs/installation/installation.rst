`here <http://www.python.org/download/>`_ or install it with your operating systemâ€™s
package manager.

You can verify that Python is installed by typing ``python`` or ``python3`` in your
shell. You should see something like::

    $ python3
    Python 3.10.1 (main, Dec 11 2021, 17:22:55) [GCC 11.1.0] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

Install OpenTAXII
-----------------
To sandbox the project and protect system-wide python it is recommended to install
OpenTAXII into a
`virtual environment <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_
(*virtualenv*).

Create a virtual environment named venv::

   $ virtualenv venv

Where ``venv`` is a directory to place the new environment

Activate this environment::

   $ . venv/bin/activate
   (venv) $

Now install the latest OpenTAXII release from the `Python
Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/>`_ (PyPI) using ``pip``::

   (venv) $ pip install opentaxii

Without the virtual environment it's just::

   $ pip install opentaxii

.. note::
    Since OpenTAXII has `libtaxii <https://github.com/TAXIIProject/libtaxii>`_ as a
    dependency, the system libraries `libtaxii` will be installed. Check
    `libtaxii documentation
    <http://libtaxii.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html#dependencies>`_ for the
    details.

To install OpenTAXII from source files: download tarball, unpack it and install it
manually with::

   $ python setup.py install


Versioning
----------

Releases of OpenTAXII are given major.minor.revision version numbers, where major and
minor correspond to the roadmap EclecticIQ has. The revision number is used to indicate
a bug fix only release.
