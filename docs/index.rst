OpenTAXII is a robust Python implementation of TAXII Services that delivers rich feature set and friendly pythonic API.

TAXII (Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information) is a collection of specifications defining a set of services and message exchanges used for sharing cyber threat intelligence information between parties. Check `TAXII homepage <https://taxiiproject.github.io/>`_ for more information.

**Rich feature set**

OpenTAXII implements all TAXII services according to TAXII specification (version 1.0 and 1.1). On top of these services, it also delivers additional functionality such as;

- customizable APIs,
- authentication,
- flexible logging.


**Designed to be extendable**

OpenTAXII architecture follows TAXII specification in its idea of TTA (TAXII transport agent) and TMH (TAXII message handler) components, separating implementations of:

      - Transport layer (`Flask <flask.pocoo.org>`_ based web app)
      - TAXII logic layer (TAXII server/services/message handlers)
      - Persistence layer (extendable Persistence API)
      - Authentication layer (extendable Authentication API)
